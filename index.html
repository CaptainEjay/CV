        <p>
        As a highly motivated and skilled professional with extensive experience and training in Operation and Maintenance,<br>
        I am confident I will make an immediate impact in this position. In my career I have been actively involved in drilling,<br>
        subsea and production operation (FPSO) activities which have broadened my knowledge and<br>
        technical know-how of executing operations activities safely while ensuring environmental impact is as low as reasonably practicable.<br>
        I have been involved in multiple Major Capital Projects where my duty included developing Operations Assurance plans (Project Operations Plans).<br>
